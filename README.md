# Pitchdeck

Hi! My name is Jan, I am dutch citizen and doing a startup (solo) for ai agents. I am looking for a small cheques of $50-250k for a total of raising a $250k pre-seed for my startup: main live production websites are https://uithub.com, https://githuq.com/, and https://github.com/janwilmake for the open source work.

- Problem: Current AI coding tools (Cursor, Lovable Dev, GitHub Copilot, Aider, etc.) are limited by running locally and requiring constant human supervision. This creates scaling bottlenecks and inconsistent output quality.

- Solution: A platform for AI Program Synthesis at scale with a strong code generation evaluation feedback loop.

- TAM: 28M professional developers worldwide

- Current traction: Growing organically through word of mouth, with recent viral tweets from notable developers reaching 1.4K+ likes. Now at 500+ WAU.

- Ask: Raising $250k via 50k+ SAFE investments as preseed round, for 12 months runway to reach monetization

- Why me? Dev since 2006, Full-time GenAI Founder since april 2022.

Use of funds:

- $2500/month cost of living in the Netherlands = $30k

- Business trips to SF and other small ones within europe (for networking) = $10k

- AI compute to offer bigger free tier = $10k

- Compute, competitions, marketing = $200k

- Cloudflare Compute = $250k (already got free credit)

Plans:

- Monetise at $50 per month + credit-based

- Paid users needed for break-even: 83

- Beta march/april, launch june.
